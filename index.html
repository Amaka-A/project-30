        <p> I was born September 2010.

            I was born in Maryland. It was kind of only me and my mother because my dad always went to work. I was little then, so my mom had to take care of me.
<h1>  My Hoverboard!</h1>
        My Hobby is riding my hoverboard, this is my one of my favorite hobby's. Every weekend I try to ride my hoverboard so I can get practice. I have been training inside of the house while having break times from school. I have mastered the process of riding the hoverboard inside but outside not so much. I don't really spend time outside riding my hoverboard often because of the coronavirus pandemic. But if I remember to I will try to spend time riding my birthday gift from my dad.<br>

            My Hoverboard is black with glowing lights every time i go on it! Isn't that AMAZING?
